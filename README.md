# Tailwind Playground

I use this repository to run and deploy quickly a website using **tailwindcss**.

It contains the [prettier-plugin-tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier) which allows to automatically organize your classes in the same order that Tailwind orders them in your CSS.

1.  Install modules
    `npm install`

2.  Build
    `npm run watch` (hot reload)
    `npm run watch`

3.  Host on a server
    I use the vscode extension [Live Server](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server)
